# RAVEN EXCHANGES SELECTION
# DO NOT add exchanges that are not added by default. Each exchange
# releases unique JSON that must be coded per exchange. If you add
# a new one, the program won't know how to handle it, and will fail.
#
# This file lists each exchange that Raven can connect to and parse from.
# Each listed exchange has the option if you want its info or not.
# The settings menu in Raven modifies this file with a nice checklist,
# but you can still modify it by doing exactly what you're doing right now.
#
# The format is <exchange, parseboolean>
#
# exchange = The exchange to parse
# parseboolean = Set to 'T' if you wants this exchange's info; F otherwise.
#
# Use the # symbol if you want to write a comment in this file.
