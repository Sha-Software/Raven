# RAVEN EXCHANGES SELECTION
# This file lists each exchange that Raven can connect to and parse from.
# Each listed exchange has the option if you want its info or not.
# The settings menu in Raven modifies this file with a nice checklist
# but you can still modify it by doing exactly what you're doing right now.
#
# If you add an exchange that isn't here by default, Raven will ignore it when
# you try to run the exchange update.
# The format is <exchange name, parseboolean>
#
# exchange name = The exchange to parse info from
# parseboolean = Set to 'T' if you wants this exchange's info; F otherwise.
#
# Use the # symbol if you want to write a comment in this file.
